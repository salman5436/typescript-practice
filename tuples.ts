//stricter cousins of arrays and are a lot more strict about what can be put into an array

//let tuple: [type, type]
let viewerData: [string, number, boolean]

viewerData = ['salman', 25, true]

//Weird thing about Tuples: This would still work even 
// viewerData.push('salman2')

//use case: useful for when the order of an array has to be maintained APIs
